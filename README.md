Train-Scheduler-Assignment

For this assignment, I created a train schedule application that incorporated Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieved and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
